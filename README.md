# Generative Art

The following is a collection of some of my generative art projects. Each project links to a dedicated repo where you can find the associated code, examples, and instructions to run for yourself.

My hope is for others to enjoy, find inspiration, and learn from these projects.

Check out this work and more on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/anna.ptasznik) or contact me at annaptasznikgeo@gmail.com.

Organization of this repo inspired by [erdavids](https://github.com/erdavids/Generative-Art).
